    <title>**Whispers of the Wind**</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>In the hush of twilight's glow,  
        Where shadows softly creep,  
        The whispers of the wind do blow,  
        Through dreams and secrets deep.
        
        The stars above, like lanterns bright,  
        Guide wanderers on their way,  
        And in the stillness of the night,  
        They dance, they laugh, they play.
        
        The moonlight paints the world in white,  
        A canvas pure and true,  
        And in the heart's most quiet light,  
        Hope blooms with morning dew.
        
        So listen close, to night’s soft breath,  
        And hear what it may bring,  
        For in the dark, in life, in death,  
        The wind’s sweet whispers sing.</p>
